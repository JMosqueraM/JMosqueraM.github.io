Greetings,

I'm writing this email regarding my situation with the age I have accidentally setted on my account.

Although I'm 19 years old, I've accidentally set my birthday to the year 2023, meaning that Roblox thinks I'm less that 1 year old.

I'm aware that I cannot change my age in the settings page of my account due the information being wrongfully set as mentioned above, hence the reason why I'm sending this support ticket.

I would like to set my account information accordingly, and have access to the feature +13 games have due to my in real life age.

Thank you for your attention,
Kind regards,
