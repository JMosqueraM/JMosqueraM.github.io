## Concepts

### Rate - Freq - Spectrum - Bandwidth
- **Rate**: Refers to the number of bits per second that can be transmitted over a communication channel[1].
- **Frequency**: Refers to the number of cycles per second of a waveform, measured in Hertz (Hz) [1].
- **Spectrum**: Refers to the range of frequencies that a signal occupies[1].
- **Bandwidth**: Refers to the range of frequencies that a communication channel can transmit[1].

### Channel Capacity (Nyquist & Shannon)
- **Nyquist**: Theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a communication channel without error, which is twice the bandwidth of the channel[1].
- **Shannon**: Theoretical limit on the maximum rate at which data can be transmitted over a communication channel without error, which is proportional to the bandwidth of the channel and the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio[1].

### LAN, WAN, others? (identify devices)
- **LAN**: Local Area Network, a network that connects devices within a limited area such as a home, school, or office building[2].
- **WAN**: Wide Area Network, a network that connects devices over a large geographical area, such as a city, country, or even the world[2].
- **Others**: Other types of networks include Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), which connect devices within a city or town, and Personal Area Networks (PANs), which connect devices within a person's immediate environment, such as a smartphone and a smartwatch[2]. Common devices used in networks include routers, switches, modems, and network interface cards (NICs) [2].

### E1/T1 Frame (Rate, bits, etc.)
- **E1**: A digital transmission format used in Europe and other parts of the world, with a data rate of 2.048 Mbps and a frame structure consisting of 32 time slots, each carrying 8 bits of data[1].
- **T1**: A digital transmission format used in North America and Japan, with a data rate of 1.544 Mbps and a frame structure consisting of 24 time slots, each carrying 8 bits of data[1].
