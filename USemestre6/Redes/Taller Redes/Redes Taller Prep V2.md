## Concepts

### Rate - Freq - Spectrum - Bandwidth
- **Rate**: The number of bits transmitted per second[1].
- **Freq**: The number of cycles per second of a periodic waveform[1].
- **Spectrum**: The range of frequencies of a signal[1].
- **Bandwidth**: The range of frequencies that a communication channel can transmit[1].

### Channel Capacity (Nyquist & Shannon)
- **Nyquist**: The maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a channel is twice the bandwidth of the channel[1].
- **Shannon**: The maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a channel is proportional to the bandwidth of the channel and the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio[1].

### LAN, WAN, others? (identify devices)
- **LAN**: A local area network is a network that connects devices in a small geographic area, such as a home, office, or building[1].
- **WAN**: A wide area network is a network that connects devices over a large geographic area, such as a city, country, or even the world[1].
- **Devices**: Examples of devices that can be connected to a LAN or WAN include computers, printers, routers, switches, and modems[1].

### E1/T1 Frame (Rate, bits, etc.)
- **E1/T1**: E1 and T1 are digital transmission formats used for telecommunications[1].
- **Frame**: A frame is a unit of data transmitted over the E1/T1 line, consisting of a fixed number of bits[1].
- **Rate**: The data rate for E1 is 2.048 Mbps, while the data rate for T1 is 1.544 Mbps[1].
