## Concepts

### Rate - Freq - Spectrum - Bandwidth
- **Rate**: The rate of data transmission refers to the amount of data that can be transmitted over a given period of time. It is usually measured in bits per second (bps) or bytes per second (Bps) [1].
- **Frequency**: Frequency refers to the number of cycles per second of a waveform. In the context of data transmission, it is used to describe the number of times a signal changes state per second. It is usually measured in Hertz (Hz) [1].
- **Spectrum**: The spectrum of a signal refers to the range of frequencies that it contains. In the context of data transmission, it is used to describe the range of frequencies that can be used to transmit data[1].
- **Bandwidth**: Bandwidth refers to the range of frequencies that can be used to transmit data. It is usually measured in Hertz (Hz) and is equal to the difference between the highest and lowest frequencies in a given frequency range[1].

### Channel Capacity (Nyquist & Shannon)
- **Nyquist**: The Nyquist theorem states that the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a channel is equal to twice the bandwidth of the channel. This means that the channel capacity is limited by the bandwidth of the channel[2].
- **Shannon**: The Shannon theorem states that the maximum data rate that can be transmitted over a channel is equal to the bandwidth of the channel multiplied by the logarithm of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the channel. This means that the channel capacity is limited by the SNR of the channel[2].

### LAN, WAN, others? (identify devices)
- **LAN**: A Local Area Network (LAN) is a network that connects devices within a small geographical area, such as a building or campus. Examples of LAN devices include switches, routers, and hubs[1].
- **WAN**: A Wide Area Network (WAN) is a network that connects devices over a large geographical area, such as a city, country, or even the world. Examples of WAN devices include routers, switches, and modems[1].

### E1/T1 Frame (Rate, bits, etc.)
- **E1**: E1 is a digital transmission format used in telecommunications. It has a data rate of 2.048 Mbps and uses a frame structure consisting of 32 time slots, each of which can carry 8 bits of data[1].
- **T1**: T1 is a digital transmission format used in telecommunications. It has a data rate of 1.544 Mbps and uses a frame structure consisting of 24 time slots, each of which can carry 8 bits of data[1].
